# CircleMap Manual Install
This installation method is for people who are using NVR or other graphics mod.

__Don't forget to backup your files!__

1. Use OpenIV to open the graphics mod, such as `z_NVR_Base.rpf`
2. Go to folder `common\data\` (if it not exists, please try open another rpf file; if all the rpf file don't have this folder, just create it)
3. Go to folder `ui\` (Create it if not exists), put the `frontend.xml` inside it.
4. Go to `platform\textures\`, usually it is in the same RPF file as `common`.
5. Open the `graphics.ytd` and replace the `radarmasksm` with this repo `radarmasksm.png`
6. Use [ArchiveFix](https://cdn.worldofcraft.cn/files/ArchiveFix.zip) to fix the RPF file (drag it on the ArchiveFix.exe)
7. Save all files and start FiveM, enjoy!
